# Files or directories to be skipped. They should be base names, not paths.
ignore=version.py,

# Add files or directories matching the regular expressions patterns to the
# ignore-list. The regex matches against paths and can be in Posix or Windows
# format. Because '\\' represents the directory delimiter on Windows systems,
# it can't be used as an escape character.

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once). You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then re-enable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use "--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W".
